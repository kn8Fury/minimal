# Sample Project(s)

## Projectile deflection using ABCDEF model

This is a Data Science project to detect incoming projectile using the Avoid Block Crash Deflect En Flight model. One of the following decisions are taken basen on the projectile:
- block the projectile
- deflect the projectile
- take evasive maneuver to avoid the projectile
- prepare for crash

This model is extremely useful in space travel. However it does not exist yet.
